Palsu
=====

*Palsu* is an interactive meeting tool that is used to demonstrate capabilities of [VIE](https://github.com/bergie/VIE). The idea is to create a tool for coordinating both online and real-world meetings. This means being able to manage:

* Meeting scheduling
* Agenda for meetings
* Collaboratively written meeting notes
* Action points (tasks) that arise in the meeting
* Participants of the meeting, and action points assigned to them

_Palsu_ comes from the Finnish word for a "meeting".
